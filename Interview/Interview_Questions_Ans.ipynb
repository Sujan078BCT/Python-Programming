Moreover, the language is capable of scripting, is completely open-source, and supports third-party packages encouraging modularity and code reuse.\n",

In a **strongly-typed** language, such as Python, **\"1\" + 2** will result in a type error since these languages don't allow for \"type-coercion\" (implicit conversion of data types). On the other hand, a **weakly-typed** language, such as Javascript, will simply output **\"12\"** as result.\n",

Although, Python doesn't require data types to be defined explicitly during variable declarations type errors are likely to occur if the knowledge of data types and their compatibility with each other are neglected. Python provides `type()` and `isinstance()` functions to check the type of these variables. These data types can be grouped into the following categories-\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Sequence Types:** According to Python Docs, there are three basic Sequence Types - `lists`, `tuples`, and `range` objects.

        "- Python is an **interpreted language**, making it slower than compiled languages like C, C++, or Java.  \n",
        "- Code execution happens **line-by-line**, causing performance delays or making it slower.  \n",
        "- Despite this, Python is still fast enough for many web and scripting applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Weak for Mobile Application Development\n",
        "- Python is rarely used for **mobile development**.  \n",
        "- Limited frameworks and support for mobile apps.  \n",
        "- Very few mobile apps (e.g., *Carbonnelle*) are built using Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Difficulty in Using Other Languages\n",
        "- Python’s simplicity and powerful libraries can make developers **too dependent** on it.  \n",
        "- Programmers may find it hard to switch to more complex languages like Java or C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. High Memory Consumption\n",

        "- Not suitable for **memory-intensive tasks**.\n",

        "- Python's database access layer is **underdeveloped** compared to JDBC/ODBC.  \n",
        "- Not ideal for large enterprises requiring **reliable integration with legacy systems**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Runtime Errors\n",
        "- Due to **dynamic typing**, many errors appear only at runtime.  \n",
        "- Requires extensive(more) testing to catch type-related issues.  \n",
        "- Python’s design can lead to unexpected runtime behaviors.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. Simplicity as a Disadvantage\n",
        "- Python’s extremely simple syntax may cause developers to become **overly reliant** on it.  \n",
        "- Transitioning to more complex languages (e.g., Java, C#) can be difficult.  \n",
